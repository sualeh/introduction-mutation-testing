# Introduction to Mutation Testing

## Step 4

Looking at the results in `./target/pit-reports/index.html` in a browser that you still have open from Step 3, you will find that not all mutations were killed by tests. We are not adequately testing `word.length() < 2`. We have already tested the lower end of the boundary condition by passing an empty string (of length 0), and a word with one character ("a"). Then we have additional tests that test with longer words, but none that  test words that are exactly 2 characters long.

We can remedy that by testing words **at** the boundary - those that are two characters long. Let us add tests for "oo" and "ah", where one word is a palindrome, and the other one is not. Take a look at [BetterPalindromeTest.java](https://github.com/sualeh/introduction-to-mutation-testing/blob/step4/src/test/java/us/fatehi/palindrome/BetterPalindromeTest.java).

Now when you run PIT again, `mvn clean test org.pitest:pitest-maven:mutationCoverage`, and look at the results in `./target/pit-reports/index.html` in a browser, you will find your tests are completely proof against bugs. 

Hopefully, this tutorial gave you an idea of how you can write well-constructed unit tests that will save you from bugs as you evolve your code base.
